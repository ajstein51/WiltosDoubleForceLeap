# WiltosDoubleForceLeap
* Description
  * This hook allows your force users on any server that has WiltOS to have force leap bound to their space bar. When a user hits SPACE while in air they will do a force jump. This means if a user does a regular force jump and then hits space once again in air they will do 2 force jumps. 
  * Doing the force leap will cost the user 30 force power.

* How to Install and Launch
  * Add the folder to your Garry's Mod addon folder

* Config
  * Add team names to the table of 'allowedTeams' that are allowed to use this ability. By base it is restricted to jobs named 'Shadow Guard', 'Sovereign Protector', 'Darth', 'Darth Vader' per the server it was created for.
  * Change the whole number at line 8 and 36 to a different number if you would like this ability to cost more or less force power
